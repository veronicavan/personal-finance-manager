## Description
Add GitHub API integration to enable direct interaction with GitHub issues, comments, and other repository features from the application.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the application requires manual posting of updates to GitHub issues. This creates friction in the workflow and makes it harder to maintain real-time documentation of progress.

## Proposed Solution
Implement GitHub API integration to allow:
1. Direct posting of comments to issues
2. Automatic issue updates
3. Status tracking
4. Progress reporting

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Set up GitHub API authentication
- [ ] Implement OAuth flow for secure access
- [ ] Create API wrapper functions for common operations:
  - [ ] Post comments
  - [ ] Update issue status
  - [ ] Create new issues
  - [ ] Add labels and assignees
- [ ] Add error handling and rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper security measures for token storage

## Security Considerations
- Store GitHub tokens securely
- Implement proper OAuth flow
- Handle token refresh
- Follow GitHub's API rate limits
- Implement proper error handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully authenticate with GitHub API
- [ ] Post comments to issues programmatically
- [ ] Update issue status automatically
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully
- [ ] Maintain proper security standards
- [ ] Document API usage

## Additional Context
This feature will improve the development workflow by automating documentation and progress tracking. It will be particularly useful for:
- Automated progress updates
- CI/CD integration
- Development status tracking
- Project management automation
