## Description
Create the AI-powered transaction categorization system.

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up ML development environment
- [ ] Create initial training dataset structure
- [ ] Implement basic categorization model
- [ ] Add user feedback mechanism
- [ ] Implement model retraining pipeline
- [ ] Create API endpoints for categorization

### Acceptance Criteria
- Model achieves >80% accuracy on initial categorization
- System learns from user corrections
- API endpoints are properly documented
- Performance meets latency requirements

### Technical Notes
- Use TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML implementation
- Implement proper model versioning
- Consider using pre-trained models for initial implementation
